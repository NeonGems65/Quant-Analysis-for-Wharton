This repository holds a variety of tools that the Lenape Wharton Investment Competition team used in 2024-25 for their quantitative financial analysis. 
The O-Score Calculator acted as the first filter for the stocks recommended to us by competition advisors, by takingthe  average financial metrics calculated from Yahoo Finance
and testing a stock's performance against a million random market conditions. 

We also used AlphaVantage's API to fetch multiple articles from the internet about a certain stock over a period of time. 
The API rates the sentiment of these articles and assigns a rating based on whether the stock was discussed as bullish or bearish.
